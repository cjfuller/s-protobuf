This packagage, s-protobuf, provides a Common Lisp implemenation for
the Protocol Buffers data encoding format, created by Google.


* Implementation Notes *

- We don't parse .proto files or use protoc to generate lisp code
  (leave C++ to the masochists), but rather read in the
  protobuf-encoded FileDescriptorSet output of protoc and compile that
- The varint handling code supports arbitrary precision.
- We don't track unknown fields


* See Also *

- description of encoding format in doc.txt


* Incompatibilities *

- varints are strictly unsigned (svarints are signed).  Cutting things
  off at 10 bytes and making it negative is a kludge.  Kenton Varda
  seems to sort of agree:

* Missing Features *

- Skipping Unknown Fields
- Default Values
- Packages
- Trackng Unknown Fields
- Support for (#-sbcl) -- only problem area is floating-point coding
- Extensions
- Services
- Packed length-delimited fields (Google may not support it, but we
  could)
